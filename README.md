## Ideas

* Avatar point clouds
* Avatar point clouds with morphing
* Generate morph points from textures
* Generic additive blended points (blue-ish)
* Bloom or similar?
* Python Discord Logo
* Some text from the discord announcement
* Possibly a "made with python" thing
* Fade cuts makes thing simple
* Blue ball thingy avatars are attracted to. It's pulsing with the music
* Find other subtle things in music we can take advantage of

Meh? Might not fit, but could be emergency filler

* Include staff + owners in some way? Show avatars at some point in the background
* Sagan image (barely visible)
* Earth Model
* Voyager model
